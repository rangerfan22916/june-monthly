        <h1 class="mb-4 text-center">Our Story</h1>
        <p>Founded in 2018, Little Bird Toys began as a heartfelt dream to bring families together through the timeless
            joy of handcrafted wooden toys. As a family-run business, our mission has always been to create toys that
            inspire creativity, imagination, and slow, meaningful playtime. In today’s fast-paced digital world, we
            believe in the power of simple, durable toys that encourage children to explore, learn, and connect with
            their surroundings in a mindful way.
        </p>
        <p>Each piece in our heirloom-quality collection is carefully crafted using sustainable Baltic birch wood and
            other premium hardwoods, selected not only for their natural beauty but also for their durability. Our toys
            are designed to withstand the test of time, becoming cherished keepsakes that can be passed down through
            generations. We believe that every toy should tell a story and hold a special place in a child’s life,
            inspiring wonder and discovery for years to come.

        </p>
        <p> At Little Bird Toys, we are deeply committed to eco-friendly manufacturing practices. From sourcing
            responsibly harvested wood to minimizing waste and using non-toxic, child-safe finishes, we prioritize
            sustainability at every step of our process. Our dedication to quality and safety means parents can trust
            that our toys are not only beautiful but also built to the highest standards, providing a safe and enriching
            experience for children of all ages.

        </p>
        <p>Our passion for creating meaningful toys is matched only by our love for community. We invite you to visit
            our cozy store in Toms River, New Jersey, where you can see and feel the magic of our handcrafted toys in
